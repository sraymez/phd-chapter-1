# BIO3 = Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (×100)
# BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation ×100)
# BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month
# BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month
# BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6)
# BIO8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter
# BIO9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter
# BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter
# BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter
# BIO12 = Annual Precipitation
# BIO13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month
