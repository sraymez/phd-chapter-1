	abstract = {There are very little population-based studies of the aetiology of ambulatory fevers in Africa using a systematic approach. Bacteraemia is likely to be identified and treated only in severe hospitalised cases. In Africa, dispensaries have been established in several areas to diagnose primary malaria for immediate treatment because of its gravity and the risk of mortality associated with the lack of a rapid treatment response. Thus, these dispensaries are able to perform samplings on all patients with fever, even within the first 24 hours, to exclude the diagnosis of malaria. For several years, these sampling centres and therapeutic management were used for the general diagnosis of fever. As malaria recedes, more cases of fever remain unexplained, justifying the development of programs to detect other infectious diseases. Traditionally several diseases are thought to responsible for acute non-malarial febrile diseases in Africa. Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers; pneumococcal bacteraemia; and a spectrum of viral infections, including influenza, yellow fever, dengue, Chikungunya fever and Rift Valley fever are among them. Diagnostics is rarely available, but PCR-based evaluations in Tanzanian hospitals showed that 7.9\% of the fevers might be due to Chikungunya fever, and 9.5\% might be due to Dengue fever. Our team specialises in emerging pathogens, and our research focuses primarily on fastidious bacteria. Since 2008 we survey the fastidious bacteria in DNA extracted in the field from the blood of acute febrile ambulatory patients in Africa, arriving to discover the causes up to 25\% of fevers in rural Senegal. However, the found spectrum of bacteria causing acute febrile diseases in Senegal is surprising. There is a high incidence of Rickettsia felis in Senegal (another team performed a parallel study under the same conditions in Kenya and observed a comparable incidence). Moreover, tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) (caused by Borrelia spp.) in West Africa has an extremely high incidence that is similar to the levels found in East Africa. The incidence of Tropheryma whipplei bacteraemiamaybe as high as 6.4\%.Weidentified also different Bartonella (including Bartonella quintana) and Coxiella burnetii as the agents.},

	abstract = {Background: yellow fever remains one of the great burdens for public health in the endemic regions in Africa and South America. The under reporting of yellow fever cases in the respective regions and lack of international interest leads to an underestimation of the constant danger in these areas. Non-vaccinated travelers take a high risk without the effective protection of YFV 17D vaccination. Objective(s): Two YF cases were imported to Europe in the last 4 years. We characterized two yellow fever virus (YFV) isolates from severely infected patients coming back from Africa, Ivory Coast and The Gambia, by genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The virus infections in different organs were analyzed with pathological, immunohistological, electronmicroscopical and quantitative real-time PCR methods. Results and Conclusion(s): High virus loads in spleen and liver (2.4 x 106 to 3 x 107 GE/mL) demonstrated by real time PCR show massive virus replication leading to extraordinary progression of the disease in these patients. Immunohistological and electronmicroscopical analysis confirms virus particles in liver tissue. In all other organs no virus could be detected. A fast, specific and sensitive virus PCR detection is recommended for diagnostic of acute infections. The further sequence alignments show that the new isolates belong to the type II West African strain with great homology to over 40-year old YF isolates from Senegal and Ghana. The divergence observed was on average 3.3\%, ranging from 0.0\% to 5.0\% in the coding region of Gambia2001 strain and 2.9 \%, ranging from 0.0\% to 4.3\% in the coding region of the IvoryC1999 strain.

The possibility of human-to-human spread, affecting all age groups and both sexes, by means of a communal toilet article was also shown. The fact that the strain is a good toxin producer but contains a weak antigen may have accounted for the repeated clinical infection and the fact that antibody titres were generally transient. Subclinical infection in animals was also found, particularly in sheep and goats, and also, with an unusually low mortality, in cows. Insect vectors were not excluded, but were unlikely. Vultures may spread the disease from village to village.

However, in 2017, low pathogenic avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses were detected in poultry in Sub-Saharan Africa. Molecular, phylogenetic, and antigenic characterization of isolates from Benin, Togo, and Uganda showed that they belonged to the G1 lineage. Isolates from Benin and Togo clustered with viruses previously described in Western Africa, whereas viruses from Uganda were genetically distant and clustered with viruses from the Middle East. Viruses from Benin exhibited decreased cross-reactivity with those from Togo and Uganda, suggesting antigenic drift associated with reduced replication in Calu-3 cells. The viruses exhibited mammalian adaptation markers similar to those of the human strain A/Senegal/0243/2019 (H9N2).

Catholic Relief Services, with funding from the CDC, supports the Ministry of Health and Social Services' (MHSS) priority of strengthening community disease surveillance. In Diourbel region, community surveillance of diseases, having epidemic outbreak potential, is managed through the Community Watch and Alert Committee (CWAC) strategy. Each CWAC member investigates suspected cases of 1 of 8 diseases under surveillance (cholera, yellow fever, measles, neonatal tetanus, bloody diarrhea, poliomyelitis, meningitis and Ebola), or any unusual event/rumor, according to community case definitions. Identified alerts are immediately notified by telephone to the Head of Health Post known as "Infirmier Chef De Poste" (ICP) who will carry out the necessary investigations within 48 hours to confirm or cancel the alert. Once the alert is confirmed, the ICP will follow instructions from the central level for the management of suspected cases, including removal of the suspected case to transport of samples to the reference laboratory for analysis. Program activities include training of community actors, regular supervision, and an evaluation after 6 months of implementation to share the results, and better understand the level of national ownership at all levels of the health system.After six months of implementation, 108 alerts were received. The top 5 disease alerts included: Bloody diarrhea: 50 alerts (42 investigated and 30 confirmed suspected cases); Cholera: 16 alerts (16 investigated and 0 confirmed); Measles: 14 alerts (12 investigated and 5 confirmed suspected cases); Yellow fever: 13 alerts (12 investigated and 10 confirmed suspected cases); and, Poliomyelitis: 5 alerts (4 investigated and 4 confirmed suspected cases).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chikungunya (CHIKV), yellow fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses circulate in sylvatic transmission cycles in southeastern Senegal, where they share common hosts and vectors. All three viruses undergo periodic amplifications, during which they are detected in mosquitoes and sometimes in hosts. However, little is known about their spatio-temporal patterns in years in which they undergo concurrent amplification. The aim of this study was to describe the co-amplification of ZIKV, CHIKV, and YFV, and the daily dynamics of these arboviruses and theirs vectors within villages in southeastern Senegal., RESULTS: Mosquitoes were collected monthly from July to December 2015. Each evening, from 6 to 9 PM, landing collections were performed by teams of 3 persons working simultaneously in 70 sites situated in forest (canopy and ground), savannah, agriculture, barren, and village (indoor and outdoor) land covers. Collections within villages were continued until 6 AM. Mosquitoes were tested for virus infection by virus isolation and RT-PCR. Seventy-five mosquito pools comprising 10 mosquito species contained at least one virus. Ae. furcifer and Ae. luteocephalus were infected by all three viruses, Ae. taylori by YFV and ZIKV, and remaining seven species by only, only YFV or only ZIKV. No single mosquito pool contained more than one virus. CHIKV was the only virus detected in all land cover classes and was found in the greatest number of sampling sites (32.9\%, n = 70). The proportion of sites in which more than one virus was detected was less than 6\%. Ae. aegypti formosus, Ae. furcifer, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. minutus, Ae. vittatus, and An. gambiae were found within villages. These vectors were mainly active around dusk but Ae. furcifer was collected until dawn. All viruses save ZIKV were detected indoors and outdoors, mainly around dusk. Virus positive pools were detected over 2, 3 and 4 months for YFV, CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively., CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the distribution of different vector species and different arboviruses vary substantially between sites, suggesting that CHIKV, YFV, and ZIKV may have different transmission cycles in Southeastern Senegal.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the leading causes of acute febrile illness (AFI) in Africa. With the advent of malaria rapid diagnostic tests, misdiagnosis and co-morbidity with other diseases has been highlighted by an increasing number of studies. Although arboviral infections and malaria are both vector-borne diseases and often have an overlapping geographic distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, information about their incidence rates and concurrent infections is scarce., METHODS: From July 2009 to March 2013 patients from seven healthcare facilities of the Kedougou region presenting with AFI were enrolled and tested for malaria and arboviral infections, i.e., yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHFV), Zika (ZIKV), and Rift Valley fever viruses (RVFV). Malaria parasite infections were investigated using thick blood smear (TBS) and rapid diagnostics tests (RDT) while arbovirus infections were tested by IgM antibody detection (ELISA) and RT-PCR assays. Data analysis of single or concurrent malaria and arbovirus was performed using R software., RESULTS: A total of 13,845 patients, including 7387 with malaria and 41 with acute arbovirus infections (12 YFV, nine ZIKV, 16 CHIKV, three DENV, and one RVFV) were enrolled. Among the arbovirus-infected patients, 48.7\% (20/41) were co-infected with malaria parasites at the following frequencies: CHIKV 18.7\% (3/16), YFV 58.3\% (7/12), ZIKV 88.9\% (8/9), DENV 33.3\% (1/3), and RVF 100\% (1/1).

	abstract = {Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is widespread in Asia, Europe, and Africa. In Senegal, sporadic cases of CCHFV have been reported since 1960. Bordering Mauritania in northeastern Senegal, Agnam is an arid area in the region of Matam where CCHFV is endemic, which harbors a pastoralist community. Given the drought conditions of Agnam, inhabitants are in constant movement with their animals in search of pasture, which brings them into contact with pathogens such as arboviruses. To identify CCHFV in this area, we established a One Health site in order to analyze animal livestock, ticks and human samples collected over a one-year period by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Our analysis showed one (1/364) patient carried anti-CCHFV IgM and thirty-seven carried anti-CCHFV IgG (37/364). In livestock, anti-CCHFV IgG was detected in 13 (38.24\%) of 34 sentinel sheep. The risk of CCHFV infection increased significatively with age in humans (p-value = 0.00117) and sheep (p-value = 1.18 x 10-11). Additional risk factors for CCHFV infection in sheep were dry seasons (p-value = 0.004) and time of exposure (p-value = 0.007). Furthermore, we detected a total of three samples with CCHFV RNA within Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi and Rhipicephalus guilhoni tick species. Our results highlighted the usefulness of a One Health survey of CCHFV in pastoral communities at risk of arboviruses.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.},

This active circulation of CCHFV motivated this study which investigated different localities of Senegal to determine the diversity of tick species, tick infestation rates in livestock and livestock infections with CCHFV. The samples were collected in July 2021 from cattle, sheep and goats in different locations in Senegal. Tick samples were identified and pooled by species and sex for CCHFV detection via RT-PCR. A total of 6135 ticks belonging to 11 species and 4 genera were collected. The genus Hyalomma was the most abundant (54\%), followed by Amblyomma (36.54\%), Rhipicephalus (8.67\%) and Boophilus (0.75\%). The prevalence of tick infestation was 92\%, 55\% and 13\% in cattle, sheep and goats, respectively. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was detected in 54/1956 of the tested pools. The infection rate was higher in ticks collected from sheep (0.42/1000 infected ticks) than those from cattle (0.13/1000), while all ticks collected from goats were negative. This study confirmed the active circulation of CCHFV in ticks in Senegal and highlights their role in the maintenance of CCHFV. It is imperative to take effective measures to control tick infestation in livestock to prevent future CCHFV infections in humans.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus that causes epizootics and epidemics among livestock population and humans. Our surveillance system has revealed multiple emergences and re-emergences of RVFV in West Africa over the last decade. Methods The Sentinel Syndromic Surveillance Network in Senegal (4S) has been implemented since 2011. Samples from human suspected arbovirus infection in 4S sentinel sites were sent to Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD), where arbovirus diagnosis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and virus isolation was performed. Overall, IPD has received a total of 1149 samples from arboviral suspected patients through the 4S network from January to December 2020. These samples were screened for 7 arboviruses including RVFV. Whole-genome sequencing of positive RVFV samples by RT-PCR was performed using the Illumina Miseq platform followed by genome assembly. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA X. Results Out of the 1149 arbovirus suspected cases, 4 RVFV-positive samples were detected with RT-PCR while 5 RVFV-positive samples were detected by ELISA. Complete genome sequences were obtained for 3 strains among the 4 positive samples by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses indicated an emergence of a virus first described in South Africa during a major outbreak. Conclusions This strong surveillance system allowed the detection of an RVFV outbreak in Senegal in 2020. The obtained genomes clustered with strains from South Africa belonging to lineage H. This calls for implementation of a strong surveillance system for wild animals, humans, and livestock simultaneously in all African countries. D/C/F/TAF is the reference for combination therapy based on protease inhibitors but has not been compared with regimens containing integrase inhibitors as initial ART. We could not demonstrate D/C/F/TAF noninferiority relative to DTG/ABC/3TC, although both regimens were similarly well tolerated.},

	abstract = {The protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma congolense, is one of the most economically important pathogens of livestock in Africa and, through its impact on cattle health and productivity, has a significant effect on human health and well being. Despite the importance of this parasite our knowledge of some of the fundamental biological processes is limited. For example, it is unknown whether mating takes place. In this paper we have taken a population genetics based approach to address this question. The availability of genome sequence of the parasite allowed us to identify polymorphic microsatellite markers, which were used to genotype T. congolense isolates from livestock in a discrete geographical area of The Gambia. The data showed a high level of diversity with a large number of distinct genotypes, but a deficit in heterozygotes. Further analysis identified cryptic genetic subdivision into four sub-populations. In one of these, parasite genotypic diversity could only be explained by the occurrence of frequent mating in T. congolense. These data are completely inconsistent with previous suggestions that the parasite expands asexually in the absence of mating. The discovery of mating in this species of trypanosome has significant consequences for the spread of critical traits, such as drug resistance, as well as for fundamental aspects of the biology and epidemiology of this neglected but economically important pathogen. © 2009 Morrison et al.},

	abstract = {Rabies is a neglected but preventable zoonotic disease that predominantly affects the most vulnerable populations living in remote rural areas of resource-limited countries. To date, every country on the African mainland is considered endemic for dog-mediated rabies with an estimated 21'500 human rabies deaths occurring each year. In 2018, the United Against Rabies collaboration launched the Global Strategic Plan to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. The epidemiology of rabies from most Western and Central African countries remains poorly defined, making it difficult to assess the overall rabies situation and progress towards the 2030 goal. In this review, we attempt to provide an overview of the current rabies situation in 22 West and Central African countries based on published scientific literature and information obtained from rabies focal points. To this end, information was collected on i) established surveillance, ii) diagnostic capacity, iii) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) availability and coverage, iv) dog population estimates, v) dog vaccination campaigns, vi) animal and human health communication (One Health), vii) molecular studies, viii) Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP), ix) cost estimates and x) national control strategies. Although rabies is a notifiable disease in the majority of the studied countries, national surveillance systems do not adequately capture the disease. A general lack of rabies diagnostic capacity has an additional negative impact on rabies surveillance and attempts to estimate rabies burden. Recurrent shortages of human rabies vaccine are reported by all of the countries, with vaccine availability usually limited to major urban centers but no country has yet adopted the new WHO-recommended 1-week intradermal vaccination regimen. Most countries carry out subsidized mass dog vaccination campaigns on World Rabies Day. Such activities are indispensable to keep rabies in the public consciousness but are not of the scale and intensity that is required to eliminate rabies from the dog population. Countries will need to scale up the intensity of their campaigns, if they are to progress towards the 2030 goal. But more than half of the countries do not yet have reliable figures on their dog populations. Only two countries reached stage 2 on the Stepwise Approach towards Rabies Elimination ladder - indicating that their national governments have truly prioritized rabies elimination and are thus providing the necessary support and political buy-in required to achieve success. In summary, the sub-region of West and Central Africa seems to be divided into countries which have accepted the challenge to eliminate rabies with governments committed to pushing forward rabies elimination, while other countries have achieved some progress, but elimination efforts remain stuck due to lacking government commitment and financial constraints. The possibility to meet the 2030 goal without international solidarity is low, because more than two-thirds of the countries rank in the low human development group (HDI {\textless}= 152). Leading countries should act as role models, sharing their experiences and capacities so that no country is left behind. Unified and with international support it is possible to reach the common goal of zero human rabies deaths by 2030.Copyright © 2020},

A seroprevalence study was carried out. Finger-prick blood samples, individual and collective details were obtained. One thousand five hundred twenty people (6 months - 83 years) were included. Overall prevalence in this group was approximately 5.2\%. The prevalence in infants (6 months - 2 years) was 8.5\%. Age, gender, contact with a pond, presence of sheep, and abortion among sheep, and individual or collective travel history were not statistically associated with prevalence. Prevalence increased significantly when the distance to a small ravine, located in the middle of the village, decreased. The results suggest a low, recent, not endemic circulation of the virus. Culex quinquefasciatus was captured near the ravine. This mosquito, similar to Culex pipiens, can play a similar role in human-to-human transmission of the RVF virus.},

	abstract = {Quarantine has been widely used during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa mainly to control transmission chains. This measure raises ethical issues that require documentation of the modalities of quarantine at the field level and its social effects for contact persons. In Senegal, 74 people were in contact with the Ebola case coming from Guinea in September 2014. Of these, 34 members of the case's household were contained together at home and monitored by officers. The remaining 40 health care workers from two facilities were dispersed in their family households and monitored by telephone or during doctors' visits. The study is based on in-depth interviews with 43 adult contacts about their experiences and perceptions, with additional observation for interpretation and contextualization.Containment at home was applied differently to contacts who lived with patient zero than to professional health care contacts. No coercion was used at first since all contacts adhered to surveillance, but some of them did not fully comply with movement restrictions. Contacts found biosafety precautions stigmatizing, especially during the first days when health workers and contacts were feeling an acute fear of contagion. The material support that was provided-food and money-was necessary since contacts could not work nor get resources, but it was too limited and delayed. The relational support they received was appreciated, as well as the protection from stigmatization by the police and follow-up workers. But the information delivered to contacts was insufficient, and some of them, including health workers, had little knowledge about EVD and Ebola transmission, which caused anxiety and emotional suffering. Some contacts experienced the loss of their jobs and loss of income; several could not easily or fully return to their previous living routines.Beyond its recommendations to enhance support measures, the study identifies the ethical stakes of quarantine in Senegal regarding informed consent and individual autonomy, non-maleficence and benevolence, and equity and adaptation to specific situations. Nevertheless, the balance between preventive benefits and individual inconveniences of quarantine should still be evaluated from a public health perspective.},

This article uses the example of the lower basin of the Senegal River as the basis for a critical analysis of these works. Various authors have suggested that circulation of the virus in Kenya may be linked to rainy years that follow relatively dry years. A pattern valid for southern or eastern Africa is unlikely to apply to the desert and semi-desert (Sahelian) areas. On the other hand, two characteristics seem to have been underestimated until now in the epidemiological cycle of RVF in West Africa: the first is transhumance and commercial movements (which determine the risk of introducing or reintroducing the virus into untouched or relatively uncontaminated areas); the second involves the time needed to reconstitute a susceptible (that is, nonimmune) animal population; this measurement makes it possible to assess the receptivity of cattle when the virus recirculates.},

The presentation of pulmonary aspergilloma is dominated by haemoptysis, the results of medical treatment are disappointing and there is significant morbidity and mortality following surgery; the only really curative treatment.

A retrospective study took place between January 2004 and September 2008 including all the cases of pulmonary aspergilloma diagnosed in private practice and{\textbackslash}or the thoracic and cardiovascular surgery service of the Fann Hospital, Dakar. Results. Thirty-five patient records were collected. The sex ratio was four males to one female. The average age of the patients was 43.7 years. All the patients had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. Serology was positive for Aspergillus Fumigatus at 22 patients out of 29 (75.86\%). Histological examination of surgical biopsies confirmed the diagnosis in 88.46\%. The treatment was essentially surgical with no recorded mortality. Nine cases of haemorrhage and eight of suppuration were reported. Conclusion. Surgery remains the reference treatment for pulmonary aspergilloma. In view of the morbidity of this condition we emphasize the importance of early screening and correct treatment of tuberculosis, particularly in endemic countries, to achieve clinical cure and prevent serious after effects. © 2011 SPLF.

	abstract = {Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is endemic in Africa, but the epidemiology remains to be defined. Using a broad database search, we reviewed the literature to better define CCHF evidence in Africa. We used a One Health approach to define the impact of CCHF by reviewing case reports, human and animal serology, and records of CCHF virus (CCHFV) isolations (1956-mid-2020). In addition, published and unpublished collection data were used to estimate the geographic distribution of Hyalomma ticks and infection vectors. We implemented a previously proposed classification scheme for organizing countries into five categories by the level of evidence. From January 1, 1956 to July 25, 2020, 494 CCHF cases (115 lethal) were reported in Africa. Since 2000, nine countries (Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, and Tunisia) have reported their first CCHF cases. Nineteen countries reported CCHF cases and were assigned level 1 or level 2 based on maturity of their surveillance system. Thirty countries with evidence of CCHFV circulation in the absence of CCHF cases were assigned level 3 or level 4. Twelve countries for which no data were available were assigned level 5. The goal of this review is to inform international organizations, local governments, and healthcare professionals about shortcomings in CCHF surveillance in Africa to assist in a movement toward strengthening policy to improve CCHF surveillance.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene},

	abstract = {Yellow fever (YF) has re-emerged in the last two decades causing several outbreaks in endemic countries and spreading to new receptive regions. This changing epidemiology of YF creates new challenges for global public health efforts. Yellow fever is caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV) that circulates between humans, the mosquito vector, and non-human primates (NHP). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we review and analyse data on the case fatality rate (CFR) and prevalence of YFV in humans, and on the prevalence of YFV in arthropods, and NHP in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, African Journal Online, and African Index Medicus databases. We included studies reporting data on the CFR and/or prevalence of YFV. Extracted data was verified and analysed using the random effect meta-analysis. We conducted subgroup, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias analyses using the random effect meta-analysis while I-2 statistic was employed to determine heterogeneity. This review was registered with PROSPERO under the identification CRD42021242444. The final meta-analysis included 55 studies. The overall case fatality rate due to YFV was 31.1\% (18.3-45.4) in humans and pooled prevalence of YFV infection was 9.4\% (6.9-12.2) in humans. Only five studies in West and East Africa detected the YFV in mosquito species of the genus Aedes and in Anopheles funestus. In NHP, YFV antibodies were found only in members of the Cercopithecidae family. Our analysis provides evidence on the ongoing circulation of the YFV in humans, Aedes mosquitoes and NHP in SSA. These observations highlight the ongoing transmission of the YFV and its potential to cause large outbreaks in SSA. As such, strategies such as those proposed by the WHO's Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) initiative are urgently needed to control and prevent yellow fever outbreaks in SSA. Author summary Yellow fever, one of the most feared lethal zoonotic disease is re-emerging as a public health threat to tropical and sub-tropical countries of South America and Africa. Despite the existence of an effective yellow fever vaccine that is administered through mass vaccination campaigns and in routine immunization programs. against this disease, the mortality remains very high during the outbreak of yellow fever in several sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. It is necessary to have accurate epidemiological data on YFV infection, in order to prioritize the policies, funding for public health interventions, and health-care planning. Our study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis with data provided on the case fatality rate (CFR) and prevalence of YFV in humans, and prevalence of YFV in arthropods, non-human primates (NHP), and other animal species in SSA. Broadly, the study shows that the CFR and prevalence of YFV in humans were relatively high and low respectively. Furthermore, mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and Anopheles funestus were the main vectors of YFV. Finally, only NHP of the Cercopithecidae family were the reservoirs of the YFV in SSA. These data provide evidence on the ongoing circulation of the YFV in SSA and the possibility of the large outbreaks YFV in SSA. Author suggests that preventive strategies should be promoted by educating and raising people's awareness about YFV infection and strengthening practitioners 'capacities towards adequate diagnosis and proper management of this infection in SSA.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) or nagana in animals, is caused by the blood-borne parasitic protozoa called trypanosomes, and is potentially fatal. It is estimated that Africa loses \$4-5 billion annually due to the death of livestock to nagana in the tsetse belt., PURPOSE: Although The Gambia lies within this belt, there is scanty data regarding the epizootiology of nagana in The Gambia. Here, records of reported cases of nagana for the period 2010-2019 at the International Trypanotolerance Centre (ITC) in The Gambia were analyzed retrospectively., METHODS: For insights into the current prevalence of AAT, blood samples of 384 cattle, 42 goats, and 59 sheep from the Central River Region (CRR) and Lower River Region (LRR) were analyzed microscopically for parasite identification. Furthermore, trypanosomes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a panel of primers that identify trypanosomes to the level of the species and subspecies by targeting a portion of the internally transcribed spacer-one (ITS-1) of the ribosomal RNA., RESULTS: The retrospective study indicates that Trypanosoma vivax (66\%) and T. congolense (33.4\%) were the predominant species. Based on the archive records of ITC, the villages Touba, Misera, and Sambel Kunda all in the CRR of the Gambia are the most burdened with AAT. Microscopic examination of blood samples from cattle showed a prevalence of 1.56\%, whereas the PCR-based analysis gave a higher prevalence of 12.5\%. The molecular analysis revealed the presence of T. vivax (3.65\%), T. congolense kilifi (2.6\%), T. b. brucei (1.3\%), T. congolense savannah/forest (0.52\%), T. b. gambiense (0.52\%). Interestingly, 4.43\% of mixed infections i.e. multiple trypanosome species in individual animals were recorded. In 18\% of the mixed infection cases, T. godfreyi, T. simiae were coinfecting cattle alongside T. congolense. The molecular identification including the phylogenetic analysis implicated T. congolense as the most predominant trypanosome species infecting animals in The Gambia., CONCLUSION: The incidence of nagana in The Gambia is documented and the prevalent trypanosomes identified to be T. vivax, different types of T. congolense, and T. brucei including the gambiense subspecie. Finally, nagana is less profound in sheep and goats compared to cattle, with seasonal and regional variations playing a significant role in the disease dynamics. Copyright © 2021.

	volume = {83},
	issn = {0002-9637},
	abstract = {The detection of highly-pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in West Africa in 2006 led to recognition of the urgent need for widespread sentinel surveillance for influenza. Only Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire were conducting influenza surveillance at this time. Since then, training and laboratory equipment have been provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NAMRU-3, the US Navy Global Emerging Infections System, the US Department of State, and the Institut Pasteur with the goal of building influenza surveillance capacity based on real-time PCR testing in several other West African countries, both among outpatients with influenza-like-illness (ILI) and among inpatients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Initial assessment visits were conducted in several countries in 2008 and 2009. To summarize current surveillance capability, these assessments and subsequent trip reports were reviewed, and ministries of health were contacted. Influenza surveillance has been conducted in Senegal since 1996, in Cote d'Ivoire since 2003 and in Ghana and Nigeria since 2007. In 2010, the numbers of ILI and SARI sites in these countries were 14/4, 9/8, 15/3, and 4/4, respectively, and they tested a total of 1550, 1382, 3848 and 1408 specimens, respectively, from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010. The initial assessment visits were conducted in Benin, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Sierra Leone and Togo. Five of these countries were judged to be ready to develop influenza surveillance capacity. They have chosen to begin surveillance with the following number of ILI and SARI sites: Niger 12/12; Mali 5/1; Mauritania 1/1; Burkina Faso 1/1; Togo 1/1. Niger and Mali have recently begun influenza surveillance. Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Togo are expected to begin in the next 2-3 months. In conclusion, significant progress has been made recently in influenza surveillance in West Africa. The capacity of countries has improved and the number of countries with functional surveillance systems is increasing.},

The aim of this study was to assess the suitability of a baculovirus expression system to produce recombinant RVFV nucleoprotein (N) for use as serodiagnostic antigen in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ability of the recombinant N antigen to detect RVFV antibody responses was evaluated in ELISA format using antisera from sheep and cattle experimentally infected with two genetically distinct wild-type RVFV strains and sera from indigenous sheep and goat populations exposed to natural RVFV field infection in The Gambia. The recombinant N exhibited specific reactivity with the N-specific monoclonal antibody and various hyperimmune serum samples from ruminants. The indirect ELISA detected N-specific antibody responses in animals with 100\% sensitivity compared to the plaque reduction neutralization test (6 to 21 days postinfection) and with 97\% and 100\% specificity in sheep and cattle, respectively. There was a high level of correlation between the indirect N ELISA and the virus neutralization test for sheep sera (R-2 = 0.75; 95\% confidence interval (CI] = 0.73 to 0.92) and cattle sera (R-2 = 0.80; 95\% CI = 0.67 to 0.97); in addition, the N-specific ELISA detected RVFV seroprevalence levels of 26.1\% and 54.3\% in indigenous sheep and goats, respectively, in The Gambia. The high specificity and correlation with the virus neutralization test support the idea of the feasibility of using the recombinant baculovirus-expressed RVFV N-based indirect ELISA to assess RVFV seroprevalence in livestock in areas of endemicity and nonendemicity.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Epidemiological surveillance (ES) which is a continuous systematic process of data collection, analysis and interpretation for decision-making is of paramount importance for a good health system. Thus, to contribute to the improvement of the health system in Senegal, a study of the functioning of the routine epidemiological surveillance system was conducted in Tambacounda from S1 to S53 of the year 2020. Methodology: A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 to 17 July 2021. Comprehensive recruitment of the district's 44 health care points was carried out. Data collection was carried out through a questionnaire prepared, pre-tested and administered to the 44 heads of public and non-public health facilities. The analyses were carried out with R software version 4.0.5. Result(s): Of the 44 health facilities surveyed, 64\% were public and 36\% were non-public. The completeness and timeliness of the data were 100\% and 97.5\%, respectively. Suspected cases of tuberculosis were the most reported. For the providers surveyed (n=44), only 65.9\% had knowledge of disease under epidemiological surveillance (DUES) and 93.2\% managed suspected cases. On-site data analysis is only performed by 20.5\% of providers. Only 38.6\% of the service delivery point (SDP) had a health area card and the ES was under the responsibility of 77.3\% of the paramedics. The training of ES officials was effective for only 45.5\% of them. Despite the availability of dry tubes (69.8\%), only 29.5\% of PSD had COVID sampling equipment. The contribution of local authorities and technical and financial partners (TFP) to the SE was 22.7\% and 29.5\% respectively. There was a statistically significant link between public SDP with knowledge of DUES (p {\textless}0.001), display of case definitions (p {\textless}0.001), feedback of reported cases, knowledge of indicators (p {\textless}0.001), existence of a health area map (p {\textless}0.001), advocacy with authorities (p=0.003), staff training (p=0.002), availability of DUES vaccines (p {\textless}0.001), availability of notification form (p {\textless}0.001) and partner contribution to ES activities. Conclusion(s): Staff training, regular monitoring of ES activities with greater involvement of nonpublic structures, and the availability of inputs applied to the six pillars of the health system, are essential elements on which action must be taken. for an efficient ES system in the Tambacounda health district for the benefit of the country's health system.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Worldwide, an estimated 20.7 million people are infected with paragonimiasis, but relatively little epidemiological data exists for Africa. Given a recently reported case, we sought to establish whether paragonimiasis should be considered as an important differential diagnosis for human TB in The Gambia, West Africa., RESULTS: We developed a novel PCR-based diagnostic test for Paragonimus species known to be found in West Africa, which we used to examine archived TB negative sputum samples from a cross-sectional study of volunteers with tuberculosis-like symptoms from communities in the Western coastal region of The Gambia. Based on a "zero patient" design for detection of rare diseases, 300 anonymised AFB smear negative sputum samples, randomly selected from 25 villages, were screened for active paragonimiasis by molecular detection of Paragonimus spp. DNA. No parasite DNA was found in any of the sputa of our patient group. Despite the recent case report, we found no evidence of active paragonimiasis infection masking as TB in the Western region of The Gambia.},

The imagos of these species were infected by intracoelomic route. Vertical transmission (transtasial and transovarial) and horizontal transmission for different stases were studied by isolation on newborn mice, polymerase chain reaction, indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA. Our results proved that 15 days after inoculation, infection rates of 100\% were noted with Hyalomma marginatum rufipes and Hyalomma truncatum. This rate is about 60\% for Amblyomma variegatum. The imagos of the three species infected have transmitted the virus to their host during blood feeding (100\%). A high transovarial transmission for Hyalomma marginatum rufipes and Hyalomma truncatum were observed (respectively 53 and 50\%). This rate is about 12\% for Amblyomma variegatum.

In all, 28 YF virus isolations were made: 19 from A. aegypti females, including 2 from newly emerged specimens; 5 were obtained from A. aegypti males, including one from a pool of newly emerged specimens, 2 from A. furcifer females, and one each from a female A. metallicus and a female A. luteocephalus. The true infection rates (TIRs) were much higher in adult A. aegypti than in specimens reared from larvae - 82\% and 31.4\% for female and male A. aegypti captured on human volunteers, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001). The TIRs for A. aegypti reared from larvae were 1.4\% and 0.5\% for females and males, respectively (P {\textgreater} 0.05). This outbreak was an intermediate YF epidemic, involving 4 vector species. Our data provide the first evidence of vertical transmission of YF virus in nature by A. aegypti, its main vector to humans, and strongly suggest that vertical transmission played a major role in the spread of the epidemic.},

	abstract = {We have examined and compared at the molecular level three strains of wild-type yellow fever (YF) virus isolated from Senegal in 1927, 1953 and 1965, termed French viscerotropic virus, Rendu and Dak1279 respectively. Over the structural protein genes, Rendu differed from the other two strains by 8\% at the nucleotide level. Rendu also differed antigenically, possessing a 'vaccine'-specific envelope (E) protein epitope (i.e. an epitope previously shown to be found on 17D and French neurotropic vaccine viruses only and not wild-type strains of YF virus). Consequently, we propose that at least two distinct genotypes of wild-type YF virus have been present in Senegal. Since Rendu virus was isolated from a fatal case of YF, it would indicate that the vaccine-specific epitope on the E protein is not associated with attenuation of the viscerotropism of wild-type YF virus.},

The nucleotide fragment of viral RNA was examined by direct sequencing of a PCR product derived from complementary DNA. Alignment with the prototype Asibi strain sequence showed divergence of 0 to 21.5\% corresponding to a maximum of 5.2\% divergence in the amino acid sequence. Taking 10\% nucleotide divergence as a cut-off point, the 22 YF virus strains fell into three topotypes which corresponded to different geographical areas, namely West Africa, Central-East Africa, and South America. Two subgroups were defined in West Africa, a genotypic group circulating in the sylvatic zone of the western part of Africa, from western Ivory Coast-Mali to Senegal, and a group responsible for large outbreaks from eastern Ivory Coast-Burkina Faso to Cameroon. Strains from Central-East Africa showed a low ratio of transition: transversion of about 1 instead of 8 to 10 for other strains, when their nucleotide sequences were compared with those of other African strains. This may reflect a more distant relationship between the former strains and the others. No change was observed in the highly conserved amino acid domain encompassing the TGD sequence, an important determinant of flavivirus tropism and pathogenesis. Our results support earlier observations on the genetic relationships between YF isolates established by T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting and offer a useful tool for the understanding of YF virus distribution and evolution.},

	abstract = {A series of 16 yellow fever (YF) viruses isolated from mosquitoes, monkeys and humans in different epidemiological contexts in Senegal and The Gambia between 1976 and 1983, was analyzed by T1 RNase oligonucleotide fingerprints of the genomic 32P-labeled RNA, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the intracellular virus-specified polypeptides, by peptide mapping of the envelope E glycoprotein and by immunological reactivities with monoclonal antibody fluids (MAF's) against the E glycoprotein. These strains had not been passed in suckling mice and were isolated in Aedes pseudoscutellaris Mos 61 cultured cells. These strains showed no virulence in three-week-old Swiss mice when injected intraperitoneally. Direct comparison of the large T1 RNase-resistant oligonucleotide maps indicated a relative genetic stability (92\%-100\%). A greater change was observed when these strains were compared with an epidemic YF strain isolated in 1965 with an oligonucleotide fingerprint map sharing 82\%-88\% similarity. The YF-specified proteins were identical in their molecular weight, and the fragments obtained after limited proteolysis of the envelope protein using protease V8 or alphachymotrypsine indicated that the strains were chemically similar. Only a few differences were observed when the strains were seroneutralized with MAF's, but no relation could be made with genetic or biological data. This suggested that the YF virus strains isolated from the same geographic area and during a short period of time had evolved slowly. Moreover, all the viruses were closely related and no correlation could be established with the apparent variations in virulence in nature.},

In 1987, RVFV emerged in Mauritania, which caused the first RVFV outbreak in West Africa. This outbreak was shortly followed by reported cases in humans and livestock in Senegal. Animal trade practices with neighboring Mauritania suggest northern regions of Senegal are at high risk for RVF. In this study, we aim to conduct a molecular and serological survey of RVFV in humans and livestock in Agnam (northeastern Senegal) by RT-PCR (reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction) and ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), respectively. Of the two hundred fifty-five human sera, one (0.39\%) tested RVFV IgM positive, while fifty-three (20.78\%) tested positive for RVFV IgG. For animal monitoring, out of 30 sheep recorded and sampled over the study period, 20 (66.67\%) showed seroconversion to RVFV IgG antibodies, notably during the rainy season. The presence of antibodies increased significantly with age in both groups (p {\textless} 0.05), as the force of RVF infection (FOI), increased by 16.05\% per year for humans and by 80.4\% per month for livestock sheep.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rabies remains a major public health problem in developing countries. Most fatal rabies cases, especially in children, result from dog bites and occur in low-income countries, such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rabies can be controlled through mass dog vaccination and human deaths prevented through timely and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). As access to appropriate PEP remains a serious challenge for bite-victims, the aim of this study was to understand the use of PEP, to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices with respect to rabies and to identify risk factors related to non-compliance with PEP to define recommendations for improving PEP in Senegal., METHODS: This study included patients with suspicion of rabies exposure who sought PEP at the Pasteur Institute of Dakar from April 2013 to March 2014. Patients with rabies clinical symptoms, those who had already started PEP and those with exposure outside Senegal or for more than 3 months were excluded. Data on risk factors and propensity to seek and complete PEP were collected using questionnaires and phone interviews. The association between acceptability and compliance with PEP and other independent variables were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis., RESULTS: Among the 905 patients enrolled into the study, 67\% were male (sex ratio M/F, 2) and 46\%, children under 15 years of age. Exposures by animal bites represented 87\%, whereas the remainder were due to scratches or contact; 76\% were classified as WHO category III and 88\% were due to dogs. Among these patients, 7\% refused to start PEP and 54.5\% completed the full schedule. Main factors reported by non-compliant patients were vaccine costs and affordability, and knowledge on status of biting animal., CONCLUSION: This study shows that despite the awareness about rabies dangers and prevention, only half of the patients completed the full PEP schedule. The following recommendations, such as free of charge prophylaxis or intradermal regimens as an alternative to intramuscular regimens, should be considered to increase the adherence to PEP at the Pasteur Institute of Dakar and in Senegal.},

	abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease mostly affecting wild and domestic ruminants. It is widespread in Africa, with spillovers in the Arab Peninsula and the southwestern Indian Ocean. Although RVF has been circulating in West Africa for more than 30 years, its epidemiology is still not clearly understood. In 2013, an RVF outbreak hit Senegal in new areas that weren't ever affected before. To assess the extent of the spread of RVF virus, a national serological survey was implemented in young small ruminants (6-18 months old), between November 2014 and January 2015 (after the rainy season) in 139 villages. Additionally, the drivers of this spread were identified. For this purpose, we used a beta-binomial ([Formula: see text]) logistic regression model. An Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach was used to fit the spatial model. Lower cumulative rainfall, and higher accessibility were both associated with a higher RVFV seroprevalence. The spatial patterns of fitted RVFV seroprevalence pointed densely populated areas of western Senegal as being at higher risk of RVFV infection in small ruminants than rural or southeastern areas. Thus, because slaughtering infected animals and processing their fresh meat is an important RVFV transmission route for humans, more human populations might have been exposed to RVFV during the 2013-2014 outbreak than in previous outbreaks in Senegal.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dynamics of most of vector-borne diseases are strongly linked to global and local environmental changes. Landscape changes are indicators of human activities or natural processes that are likely to modify the ecology of the diseases. Here, a landscape approach developed at a local scale is proposed for extracting mosquito favourable biotopes, and for testing ecological parameters when identifying risk areas of Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission. The study was carried out around Barkedji village, Ferlo region, Senegal., METHODS: In order to test whether pond characteristics may influence the density and the dispersal behaviour of RVF vectors, and thus the spatial variation in RVFV transmission, we used a very high spatial resolution remote sensing image (2.4 m resolution) provided by the Quickbird sensor to produce a detailed land-cover map of the study area. Based on knowledge of vector and disease ecology, seven landscape attributes were defined at the pond level and computed from the land-cover map. Then, the relationships between landscape attributes and RVF serologic incidence rates in small ruminants were analyzed through a beta-binomial regression. Finally, the best statistical model according to the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small samples (AICC), was used to map areas at risk for RVF., RESULTS: Among the derived landscape variables, the vegetation density index (VDI) computed within a 500 m buffer around ponds was positively correlated with serologic incidence (p{\textless}0.001), suggesting that the risk of RVF transmission was higher in the vicinity of ponds surrounded by a dense vegetation cover. The final risk map of RVF transmission displays a heterogeneous spatial distribution, corroborating previous findings from the same area., CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the potential of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data for identifying environmental risk factors and mapping RVF risk areas at a local scale.},

	abstract = {During the rainy season, the abundance of mosquitoes over the Barkedji area (Senegal) is linked to dynamic, vegetation cover and turbidity of temporary and relatively small ponds. The latter create a variable environment where mosquitoes can thrive and thus contribute to diffusion and transmission of diseases such as the Rift Valley Fever (RVF, with Aedes vexans arabiensis and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes) in the Ferlo. The small size and complex distribution of ponds require the use of high-spatial resolution satellite images for adequate detection. Here the use of SPOT-5 images (10 m-resolution) allows for detailed assessment of spatiotemporal evolution of ponds, through two new indices: the Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI) and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI). Small ponds less than 0.5 ha dominate whatever the time period. For example they represent nearly 65\% of the total ponds during the peak of the rainy season, up to 90\% at the end of the same season. Moreover, another product is proposed: the Zone Potentially Occupied by Mosquitoes (ZPOM). During the apex of the summer monsoon, it is found that RVF mosquitoes occupy 25\% of the Barkedji area, while only 0.9\% of the same area is covered by ponds. Overlapping areas occupied by grazing cattle and mosquitoes, enhance RVF virus transmission. Temporary ponds could be considered as a good epidemiologic indicator for different vectors of infectious diseases. The goal is to first use operational and high-spatial resolution remote sensing images to detect all ponds for potential mosquitoes' presence and breeding sites. The resulting ZPOM is obtained from entomological field-studies and mapped using flying ranges and spatial distribution of vectors (flying ranges of mosquitoes is 500-600 m around ponds). The second step is to establish dynamic maps of mosquitoes' density, starting from regular data of the rainfall events. This work is carried out by integrating results of studies on mechanisms of emergence, proliferation and diffusion of the vectors (the distribution of rainfall events (frequency and intensity), the flying range of mosquitoes and their aggressiveness). Then, after developing hazard maps, vulnerability (host' evaluation) and risk maps (host exposure to vectors), all fundamental components of our HEWS are already defined. Thanks to remotely sensed operational indices and products presented here are meant to better understand the mechanisms at stake and to contribute to the development of early warning systems in a changing climate and environment. Combining a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach involving rainfall data (seasonal forecasts and near realtime observations), ponds and differences in ZPOMs as a function of ecozones, biological data such as vector aggressiveness, virus transmission and pastoralism, should make it possible to evaluate dynamical RVF risks.},

	abstract = {Rabies, a zoonotic disease, is one of the deadliest and most serious threats to public health as it has an almost 100 \% case fatality rate. The global estimated mortality of the virus is between 40,000 to 70,000 deaths annually with most of the death occurring in the developing countries of Africa and Asia. The objective of this study was to present the incidence and mortality rates from rabies in 28 African countries from 2005 to 2018. Secondary data were obtained from the World Organization for Animal Health Database. The data from 2005 to 2018 were used, as this was the period with available data in the database. The data were analysed using SPSS version 25 and other descriptive statistical tools. The highest combined rabies incidence and mortality in the time range (2005 - 2018) was 1601 in 2006, while the lowest was 157 in 2005. Just five countries (Angola, Central African Republic, Kenya, Mozambique and Senegal) had 65 \% of the rabies cases and mortality. Notably, the data on the incidence and mortality were 100 \% similar, as all of the cases of rabies in the 28 African countries within 2005 - 2018 resulted in death. Therefore, more work should be devoted to research on rabies prevention and cure. Toward that goal, practices and policies should be implemented to enable the acquisition of accurate and consistent rabies data.Copyright © 2020 M. A. Adesina et al., published by Sciendo 2020.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding the occurrence of yellow fever epidemics is critical for targeted interventions and control efforts to reduce the burden of disease. We assessed data on the yellow fever incidence and mortality rates in Africa. Method(s): We searched the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, Embase, Africa-wide and Web of science databases from 1 January 1975 to 30th October 2020. Two authors extracted data from included studies independently and conducted a meta-analysis. Result(s): Of 840 studies identified, 12 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. The incidence of yellow fever per 100,000 population ranged from {\textless} 1 case in Nigeria, {\textless} 3 cases in Uganda, 13 cases in Democratic Republic of the Congo, 27 cases in Kenya, 40 cases in Ethiopia, 46 cases in Gambia, 1267 cases in Senegal, and 10,350 cases in Ghana. Case fatality rate associated with yellow fever outbreaks ranged from 10\% in Ghana to 86\% in Nigeria. The mortality rate ranged from 0.1/100,000 in Nigeria to 2200/100,000 in Ghana. Conclusion(s): The yellow fever incidence rate is quite constant; in contrast, the fatality rates vary widely across African countries over the study period. Standardized demographic health surveys and surveillance as well as accurate diagnostic measures are essential for early recognition, treatment and control.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).},

	volume = {100},
	issn = {0037-9085},
	abstract = {The aim was to undertake a pilot study of integrated surveillance of yellow fever (YF) in Senegal, based on i) a human surveillance involving healthcare centers in the 11 administrative regions of the country ii) an entomological surveillance including domestic and sylvatic environment and iii) screening mosquitoes for YF virus using RT-PCR method. The integrated approach of human and entomological surveillance was conducted for 2 years (2003-2004). Surveillance in human population was based on screening samples of YF suspected cases (i.e. patients with acute ({\textless}= 15 days) febrile illness with jaundice) for YF specific IgM antibodies. The entomological surveillance was carried out by collecting mosquitoes using human landing catch method and attempt to detect YF virus on them by RT-PCR. Forty five percent of the healthcare centres notified at least one suspected YF case during 2003-2004 periods. Among the 342 sera collected over 2 years, 2 revealed anti-YF IgM antibodies leading to investigations which allowed identification of the source and place of infection and implementation of a reactive focused YF immunization campaign. In addition, YFV was detected by RT-PCR from 49 out of 1762 mosquitoes tested and distributed as follows: in the sylvatic environment, 29 from Aedes furcifer and 1 from Aedes aegypti while in the domestic area, 15 Aedes aegypti and 4 Aedes furcifer. RT-PCR was found more sensitive and rapid than viral isolation for YF virus detection in mosquitoes. The pilot study in Senegal for YF surveillance integrating human and entomological parameters in domestic and sylvatic areas showed that this approach is very efficient in detecting yellow fever virus circulation due to the complementarity of the two systems. Therefore, in the light of the encouraging results presented herein, similar studies in different context and areas are needed to further validate and allow the extension of its application to other endemic regions of Africa.},

	abstract = {Estimating the epidemic potential of vector-borne diseases, along with the relative contribution of underlying mechanisms, is crucial for animal and human health worldwide. In West African Sahel, several outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) have occurred over the last decades, but uncertainty remains about the conditions necessary to trigger these outbreaks. We use the basic reproduction number (R0) as a measure of RVF epidemic potential in northern Senegal, and map its value in two distinct ecosystems, namely the Ferlo and the Senegal River delta and valley. We consider three consecutive rainy seasons (July-November 2014, 2015 and 2016) and account for several vector and animal species. We parametrize our model with estimates of Aedes vexans arabiensis, Culex poicilipes, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, cattle, sheep and goat abundances. The impact of RVF virus introduction is assessed every week over northern Senegal. We highlight September as the period of highest epidemic potential in northern Senegal, resulting from distinct dynamics in the two study areas. Spatially, in the seasonal environment of the Ferlo, we observe that high-risk locations vary between years. We show that decreased vector densities do not greatly reduce R0 and that cattle immunity has a greater impact on reducing transmission than small ruminant immunity. The host preferences of vectors and the temperature-dependent time interval between their blood meals are crucial parameters needing further biological investigations. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Bovine trypanosomiasis is a disease of cattle. In sub-Saharan Africa, the disease mean prevalence estimates are unknown in most endemic countries. We therefore performed a meta-analysis with the aim of estimating national mean prevalence of bovine trypanosomiasis in endemic countries across sub-Saharan Africa. Relevant articles reporting bovine trypanosomiasis prevalence were retrieved through systematic literature search and scanning of articles reference-lists. Eligibility criteria included that articles reported sample size, prevalence, and diagnostic technique adopted. Overall, data from 180 eligible articles from 19 countries satisfied the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of prevalence data based on the random-effects model resulted in an overall mean prevalence of 15.10\% (95\% CI: 13.22-17.08). National prevalence estimates were generally high except those of Benin and Senegal where estimates ranked below 10.00\%. Significant heterogeneity (I2 = 98.75\%. p = {\textless}0.0001) was noted between studies, and univariate meta-regression analysis identified choice of diagnostic method being major contributor to observed heterogeneity (R2 = 36.37\%); while country of study (R2 = 9.57\%) and sample size (R2 = 3.47\%) had marginal effect on heterogeneity. In spite of past and ongoing control activities, bovine trypanosomiasis remains highly prevalent in most endemic sub-Saharan African countries. Nevertheless, dearth of epidemiological data in some countries and the use of less sensitive diagnostic tools limit reliable estimation of the disease prevalence. Therefore, there is the need to intensify efforts in aspects of surveillance and increased application of molecular diagnostic tool(s) across endemic locations as this would raise the chances of achieving a near-accurate estimate of the disease prevalence which is the first step to attempting eradication.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A technique for the rapid field assessment of African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) was developed during studies in the Gambia. This involved gathering indigenous information from rapid-appraisal questionnaires addressed to local informants, the results of single tsetse surveys and evaluations of the prevalence of trypanosome infections in village cattle. Local informants included livestock owners and herdsmen and trained personnel such as livestock assistants. The answers to the questionnaires were weighted in order to translate them into semi-quantitative ranked estimates (zero, low, medium, high or very severe) of the severity of AAT problems. A similar ranking was also defined for tsetse and prevalence data in the Gambia. The three assessment methods generally gave complementary results leading to similar conclusions about the severity of tsetse-trypanosomosis problems in a survey area; inconsistencies usually suggested that additional information was needed. The rankings of AAT intensity were used to develop management guidelines for minimising the impact of AAT at different levels through control interventions or improved livestock management. The methodology was designed to provide reliable, up-to-date and cost-effective assessments of AAT problems. Emphasis was placed on the importance of the involvement, priorities and perceptions of village livestock owners and herdsmen in making these assessments.},

	volume = {77},
	issn = {0300-5283},
	abstract = {Introduction: Avian influenza (AI) H9N2 is an economical and public health threat. It has become a major problem in the poultry industry in many countries. Although H9N2 viruses are considered low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), they pose a significant threat to public health as they are considered viruses with pandemic potential. In 2021, H9N2 viruses were isolated from tracheal swabs of violet turaco (Musophaga violacea) that had been imported from Mali to Malaysia. Objective(s): In this study, we described the molecular characterization of H9N2 viruses based on hemagglutinin (HA) gene. Material(s) and Method(s): Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to characterize the H9N2 virus. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): The HA sequence of the isolate showed {\textgreater}97\% nucleotide identity with those of H9N2 viruses isolated from chickens in African countries in 2017. The amino acids in the HA cleavage site showed a typical motif of the LPAI (PARSSR/GLF). Notably, the isolate had leucine (L) at position 226 at the receptor binding site, indicating that this isolate has the potential to infect mammals including humans. Phylogenetic studies showed that this H9N2 isolate belonged to lineage G1 and was very similar to viruses isolated from an outbreak in chickens in Senegal and Morocco. The isolate in this study was found to belong to the G1 lineage and this is the first time this lineage is reported in Malaysia. Previously, lineage Y-280 and Korean have been reported. In conclusion, the international trade of birds carrying AI viruses may pose a serious threat not only to the poultry industry but also to humans. Thus, the most important step in avoiding the spread of this disease is to screen imported birds for infections. Furthermore, effective quarantine system and diagnostic capabilities are critical in preventing the entry of foreign AI strains.},

	abstract = {Rabies is a fatal neurologic disease caused by lyssavirus infection. People are infected through contact with infected animals. The relative increase of human rabies acquired from bats calls for a better understanding of lyssavirus infections in their natural hosts. So far, there is no experimental model that mimics natural lyssavirus infection in the reservoir bat species. Lagos bat virus is a lyssavirus that is endemic in straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in Africa. Here we compared the susceptibility of these bats to three strains of Lagos bat virus (from Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana) by intracranial inoculation. To allow comparison between strains, we ensured the same titer of virus was inoculated in the same location of the brain of each bat. All bats (n = 3 per strain) were infected, and developed neurological signs, and fatal meningoencephalitis with lyssavirus antigen expression in neurons. There were three main differences among the groups. First, time to death was substantially shorter in the Senegal and Ghana groups (4 to 6 days) than in the Nigeria group (8 days). Second, each virus strain produced a distinct clinical syndrome. Third, the spread of virus to peripheral tissues, tested by hemi-nested reverse transcriptase PCR, was frequent (3 of 3 bats) and widespread (8 to 10 tissues positive of 11 tissues examined) in the Ghana group, was frequent and less widespread in the Senegal group (3/3 bats, 3 to 6 tissues positive), and was rare and restricted in the Nigeria group (1/3 bats, 2 tissues positive). Centrifugal spread of virus from brain to tissue of excretion in the oral cavity is required to enable lyssavirus transmission. Therefore, the Senegal and Ghana strains seem most suitable for further pathogenesis, and for transmission, studies in the straw-colored fruit bat.},

During this outbreak, we studied the association of the abundance of YFV-infected mosquitoes and land cover features to try and understand the dynamics of YFV transmission within the region. In total, 41,234 mosquito females were collected and tested for virus infection in 5,152 pools. YFV was detected in 67 pools; species including Aedes furcifer (52.2\% of the infected pools), Ae. luteocephalus (31.3\% of the infected pools), Ae. taylori (6.0\% of the infected pools) and six other species (10.4\% of the infected pools) captured in September (13.4\%), October (70.1\%), and November (16.4\%). Spatially, YFV was detected from mosquitoes collected in all land cover classes but mainly, forest canopies (49.2\%). Human infection is likely mediated by Ae. furcifer, the only species found infected with YFV within villages. Villages containing YFV-infected mosquitoes were significantly closer to large forests ({\textgreater} 2 ha) than villages in which no infected mosquitoes were detected.

RVF epizootics are characterized by numerous abortions and mortality among young animals. In humans, the illness is usually characterized by a mild self-limited febrile illness, which could progress to more serious complications. RVF virus is widespread and endemic in many regions of Africa. In Western Africa, several outbreaks have been reported since 1987 when the first major one occurred at the frontier of Senegal and Mauritania. Aiming to evaluate the spreading and molecular epidemiology in these countries, RVFV isolates from 1944 to 2008 obtained from 18 localities in Senegal and Mauritania and 15 other countries were investigated. Our results suggest that a more intense viral activity possibly took place during the last century compared to the recent past and that at least 5 introductions of RVFV took place in Senegal and Mauritania from distant African regions. Moreover, Barkedji in Senegal was possibly a hub associated with the three distinct entries of RVFV in West Africa.},

Progressive neglect of the disease, however, led to a new outbreak in 1927 during which the etiological agent was isolated; some years later a vaccine was discovered and yellow fever disappeared again. In the 1960s, rare cases of encephalitis were observed in young children after vaccination and the administration of the vaccine was forbidden for children under 10 years. Five years later, a new outbreak of yellow fever in Diourbel, Senegal, was linked to the presence of Aedes aegypti. In the late 1970s, the idea of a selvatic cycle for yellow fever arose. Thanks to new investigative techniques in Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire, the yellow fever virus was isolated from the reservoir of virus and vectors. The isolated virus was identified in monkeys and several vectors: Aedes furcifer, Aedes taylori, Aedes luteocephalus. Most importantly, the virus was isolated in male mosquitoes. Until recently, the only known cycle had been that of Haddow in East Africa. The virus circulate in the canopea between monkeys and Aedes africanus. These monkeys infect Aedes bromeliae when they come to eat in banana plantations. This cycle does not occur in West Africa. Vertical transmission is the main method of maintenance of the virus through the dry season. "Reservoirs of virus" are often mentioned in medical literature, monkeys having a short viremia whereas mosquitoes remain infected throughout their life cycle. In such a selvatic cycle, circulation can reach very high levels and no child would be able to escape an infecting bite and yet no clinical cases of yellow fever have been reported. The virulence--as it affects man--of the yellow fever virus in its wild cycle is very low. In areas where the virus can circulate in epidemic form, two types of circulation can be distinguished. Intermediate yellow fever--a term coined to define epidemia which do not correspond exactly to urban yellow fever. The cycle involves men and monkeys through wild vectors as Aedes furcifer but also through Aedes aegypti and the mortality rate is much lower than for urban epidemics. In urban yellow fever, man is the only vertebrate host involved in the circulation of the virus, the vector being generally Aedes aegypti. This vector maintains a selective pressure, increasing the transmission of virus capable of producing high viremia in man. In the selvatic cycles, two cycles can be distinguished: one of maintenance which does not increase the quantity of virus in circulation and one of amplification which does increase this quantity. As we shall see, it develops into an epizootic form but also in an epidemic form in man. When the decrease in yellow fevers across Africa is considered, it appears that all major epidemics occur in West Africa inspite of the presence of wild cycles of the yellow fever virus in Central and East Africa. For the rare epidemics that have occurred there, the vector has never been Aedes aegypti. In a recent outbreak in Kenya, the vector was Aedes bromeliae. The examination of part of the gene encoding for envelope protein showed the presence of two geographical types corresponding to West-Africa and Central East-Africa. Clinically speaking, yellow fever is an haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis similar to other haemorrhagic fevers such as Rift Valley fever. When, in 1987, an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever occurred in southern Mauritania, for several days it was thought to be yellow fever. Four days later, the diagnosis was corrected by isolating and identifying the virus as that of Rift Valley fever (RVFV). RVFV causes several pathogenic syndromes in human beings: acute febrile illness, haemorrhagic fever, haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis, nervous syndromes or ocular disease. Mortality rate was high for haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis, reaching 36\%. (ABST},

	abstract = {In a study of the prevalence and incidence of trypanosomosis in horses and donkeys in two regions of the Gambia, surveys were carried out at Niamina east and Bansang south with a high and low to moderate tsetse challenge, respectively. Eleven horses and 67 donkeys were sampled monthly from August 1997 to September 1998. Blood samples were examined for trypanosomes using the buffy-coat (BC) method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three primer sets were used, specific for either Trypanosoma vivax (TVW), Trypanosoma congolense (GOL) or Trypanosoma brucei (ORPHON5J). The BC results showed that the prevalence (August 1997) and the average monthly incidence (September 1997-1998) of trypanosome infections in horses (45.5 and 16\%, respectively) were significantly higher than in donkeys (6.2 and 9\%, respectively). Using PCR, the number of detected cases was seven times higher than using the BC. T. congolense was the most frequently observed species, followed by T. vivax and T. brucei. This study confirms earlier observations by other authors that donkeys, which are exposed to a similar tsetse challenge as horses, are significantly less infected with trypanosomes than the latter.},

	abstract = {Background: The WHO guidelines for the management of advanced HIV disease recommend a package of care consisting of rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), enhanced screening and diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and cryptococcal meningitis, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), fluconazole pre-emptive therapy, and adherence support. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalence of advanced HIV disease among individuals initiating ART in Senegal, to identify predictors of advanced disease, and to evaluate adherence to the WHO guidelines. Method(s): This study was conducted among HIV-positive individuals initiating ART in Dakar and Ziguinchor, Senegal. Clinical evaluations, laboratory analyses, questionnaires and chart review were conducted. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of advanced disease. Result(s): A total of 198 subjects were enrolled; 70\% were female. The majority of subjects (71\%) had advanced HIV disease, defined by the WHO as a CD4 count {\textless} 200 cells/mm3 or clinical stage 3 or 4. The median CD4 count was 185 cells/mm3. The strongest predictors of advanced disease were age {\textgreater}= 35 (OR 5.80, 95\%CI 2.35-14.30) and having sought care from a traditional healer (OR 3.86, 95\%CI 1.17-12.78). Approximately one third of subjects initiated ART within 7 days of diagnosis. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was provided to 65\% of subjects with CD4 counts {\textless}=350 cells/mm3 or stage 3 or 4 disease. TB symptom screening was available for 166 subjects; 54\% reported TB symptoms. Among those with TB symptoms, 39\% underwent diagnostic evaluation. Among those eligible for IPT, one subject received isoniazid. No subjects underwent CrAg screening or received fluconazole to prevent cryptococcal meningitis. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to report an association between seeking care from a traditional healer and presentation with WHO defined advanced disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Given the widespread use of traditional healers in sub-Saharan Africa, future studies to further explore this finding are indicated. Although the majority of individuals in this study presented with advanced disease and warranted management according to WHO guidelines, there were numerous missed opportunities to prevent HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. Programmatic evaluation is needed to identify barriers to implementation of the WHO guidelines and enhanced funding for operational research is indicated.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).},

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in colonisation, and the burden of clinically relevant pulmonary NTM (PNTM) disease in The Gambia. This was a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of NTM in participants aged{\textgreater}=15 years, in a nationwide tuberculosis (TB) prevalence survey between December 2011 and January 2013. We enrolled 903 participants with suspected NTM and NTM cultures were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses. We applied the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America (ATS/IDSA) diagnostic criteria to determine clinical relevance of NTM. A total of 575 participants had acid-fast bacilli (AFB) positive Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) cultures and 229 (39.8\%) were NTM. M. avium complex was by far the most isolated NTM (71.0\%), followed by M. fortuitum (9.5\%) and M. nonchromogenicum (2.9\%). Older participants ({\textgreater}24 years old) were four times more likely to have NTM in their sputa. Only 20.5\% (9/44) NTM cases met the ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. This study provides important data on the prevalence of NTM in pulmonary samples of suspected TB cases with AFB positive cultures from a nationally representative population in The Gambia. Enhanced PNTM surveillance is recommended to better understand the contribution of NTM to pulmonary disease.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).},

To better understand the molecular epidemiology of rabies virus in Senegal, we investigated the genetic diversity of 18 new characterized Senegalese rabies virus sequences collected over 14 years, including a honey-badger-related isolate. Phylogeographic analyses demonstrated that the Senegalese isolates belong to a monophyletic cluster into the Africa-2 clade and supported two RABV introductions in Senegal from West-African neighbour countries, 36-40 years ago. Our study is noteworthy for reporting on the first characterization of an African honey-badger-related rabies virus that did not have the N-glycosylation site NKT at position 338-G of the glycoprotein. The identified amino acid polymorphisms found in the Senegalese rabies virus sequences are worthy of further investigation. Although a strong multidisciplinary stepwise cooperation is important for the successful elimination of Rabies in dog populations in Senegal by 2030, the establishment of surveillance in wildlife could be necessary to avoid future re-introductions into domestic hosts.

	abstract = {The most widespread method used for the detection of nucleic acids of etiological agents in clinical samples is real time polymerase chain reaction. During outbreak, clinical samples are sent long distances to the laboratory for analysis, hence real time cyclers are not suitable for point-of-care diagnostics because it is heavy, big, expensive, complex, and must be managed by qualified staff. In addition, test run time is between 60-90 minutes. This study describes the development of real time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assays for the detection of Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola virus, Sudan virus, Bundibugiyo virus, Marburg virus, Dengue Virus, and Yellow fever virus. Quantitative RNA molecular standards were generated and used to determine RT RPA assays sensitivity. The analytical sensitivities of RT-RPA assays ranged from 16 to 3778 RNA molecules detected (probit analysis). RT-RPA was performed at 42degreeC and yielded results after 2 to 15 minutes. The assays showed neither cross-detection of any of the target genomes of the panel nor of the human genome. To test the possibility of using RT-RPA assays for outbreak investigations, a mobile RT-RPA unit was operated in Kedougou, in Senegal. A magnetic-bead based total nucleic acid extraction method was combined with RT-RPA on a portable instrument (tubescanner). Dried pellet RT-RPA reagents and dried oligonucleotides were used. The whole RT-RPA panel was successfully used to detect viral RNA extracted from gamma-irradiation inactivated lyophilised virus supernatants. All operations were carried out at an ambient temperature of 38degreeC with auxiliary electricity tapped from a vehicle. In conclusion, the developed assay protocol and mobile setup performed well and should be useful for rapid highly sensitive and specific detection of the haemorrhagic fever viruses in outbreak investigations.},

	abstract = {The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a threat that must not be neglected, as the consequences of RVFV are dramatic, both for human and animal health. This virus is a zoonotic virus that already has demonstrated a real capacity for re-emerging after long periods of silence, as observed in Barkedji (Senegal, West Africa) in 2002. In this article we present the 2nd emergence in Barkedji after the 1st manifestation in 1993, and for the 1st time the circulation of RVFV during 2 consecutive years among mosquito populations in Senegal. As part of the entomological surveillance program undertaken since 1990 to detect circulation of the RVFV in Barkedji, 108,336 mosquitoes belonging to 34 species and 5 genera were collected in 2002-2003. Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes, previously known to be vectors of RVFV in Senegal, comprised 88.7\% of the total collection. In 2002, Ae. vexans was the most abundant mosquito, followed by Cx. poicilipes; the opposite situation was observed in 2003. In 2002, 29 and 10 RVFV isolates were obtained from Cx. poicilipes (minimum infection rate [MIR] = 0.13\%) and Ae. vexans (MIR = 0.02\%) pools, respectively and the MIR for the 2 species were significantly different (chi2 = 34.65; df = 1, P {\textless} 0.001). In 2003, 7 RVFV strains were isolated from Cx. poicilipes (3, MIR = 0.03), Mansonia africana (2, MIR = 0.08), Ae. fowleri (1), and Ma. uniformis (1, MIR = 0.05). The 3 latter species were found to be associated with RVFV for the 1st time in Senegal. A significant decrease in MIR was observed from 2002 to 2003 (chi2 6.28; df = 1, P = 0.01) for Cx. poicilipes, the only species involved in the transmission during the 2 sampling years.},

	abstract = {Background: Yellow fever (YF) is an acute infectious viral disease transmitted by Aedesmosquitoes that causes 200,000 human cases and 30,000 deaths annually in tropical Africa and South America. Human cases follow periodic emergence YF virus (YFV) from its sylvatic cycle in non-human primates. In Senegal, the Kedougou region is an emergence zone where amplifications of sylvatic YFV have been reported at 4 to 6 years interval. Since 2007, gold mining has become the main economic activity in Kedougou and has led to increased urbanization, more activity in the forest and massive immigration of non-immune populations. In association with these disruptions, a YF outbreak occurred in Kedougou in 2010. In this paperwereport epidemiological, virological and entomological information about this outbreak. Methods \& Materials: An human surveillance of Acute Febrile illnesses were implemented in 7 clinics in Kedougou region. Also entomologic andmonkeysurveys were carried out in thesamearea. Human and monkey samples were tested for YFV- PCR and IgM and IgG YF antibodies by ELISA. Mosquitoes were sorted in monospecific pools and tested by YFV RT-PCR. Result(s): From January 2010 to December 2011 9,213 patients were enrolled and 13 were confirmed as YF (0.14\%), including 12 IgM antibody positives, and 2 PCR positive and 10 probable cases. Three thousand four hundred and seventy seven (3,477) and 1,793 mosquito pools were respectively collected and tested for YFV by PCR and virus isolation in 2010 and 2011. YFV was detected in 67 pools of mosquitoes (1.9\%). Additionally, 378 monkeys were screened for anti-YFV IgM and neutralizing antibody; one monkey sample presented anti-YFV IgM, and seroprevalence of YF neutralizing antibodies among juvenile monkeys increased from 4 to 42\% between 2010 and 2011. Entomological investigations during the YF outbreak revealed that Ae. aegypti was present in all localities;Aedes furcifer was the predominant species and Breteau indexes were well above the epidemic threshold. Conclusion(s): Increased urbanization and migration of susceptible populations may favor adaptation of Ae Aegypti to domestic context and the presence of infected Aedes furcifer that would lead to intermediate or urban transmission of YFV.},

Incidence of the infection was evaluated by a serosurvey in the area. Males 10-29 years old belonging to the Peul ethnic group were more affected. Moreover, 28 YF virus strains were isolated from mosquitoes and larvae pools and vertical transmission of YF virus by Aedes aegypti was also demonstrated for the first time in the field. This outbreak occurred after the major amplification of the wild cycle of YF virus in 1993 in West Africa. This epidemic represented a typical example of intermediate transmission of YF: both humans and wild vertebrates are involved in the virus cycle through wild mosquitoes with semidomestic habits, mainly Ae. furcifer, Ae. luteocephalus, and domestic vector Ae. aegypti. It was controlled by a prompt immunization campaign. The impact of inclusion of YF vaccine in the Expanded Program of Immunization, which has been conducted in Senegal for eight years, is discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of human deaths due to rabies is currently underestimated to be 55,000 deaths per year. Biological diagnostic methods for confirmation of rabies remain limited, because testing on postmortem cerebral samples is the reference method, and in many countries, sampling brain tissue is rarely practiced. There is a need for a reliable method based on a simple collection of nonneural specimens., METHODS: A new reverse-transcription, heminested polymerase chain reaction (RT-hnPCR) protocol was standardized at 3 participating centers in Cambodia, Madagascar, and France. Fifty-one patients from Cambodia, Madagascar, Senegal, and France were prospectively enrolled in the study; 43 (84\%) were ultimately confirmed as having rabies. A total of 425 samples were collected from these patients during hospitalization. We studied the accuracy of the diagnosis by comparing the results obtained with use of biological fluid specimens (saliva and urine) and skin biopsy specimens with the results obtained with use of the standard rabies diagnostic procedure performed with a postmortem brain biopsy specimen., RESULTS: The data obtained indicate a high specificity (100\%) of RT-hnPCR and a higher sensitivity ({\textgreater}/=98\%) when the RT-hnPCR was performed with skin biopsy specimens than when the test was performed with fluid specimens, irrespective of the time of collection (i.e., 1 day after the onset of symptoms or just after death). Also, a sensitivity of 100\% was obtained with the saliva sample when we analyzed at least 3 successive samples per patient., CONCLUSIONS: Skin biopsy specimens should be systematically collected in cases of encephalitis of unknown origin. These samples should be tested by RT-hnPCR immediately to confirm rabies; if the technique is not readily available locally, the samples should be tested retrospectively for epidemiological purposes.},

	issn = {0923-2516},
	abstract = {Severe haemorrhagic disease among the human population of the Senegal River Basin brought the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) outbreak of 1987 to the attention of science. As in previous RVFV outbreaks, local herdsmen reported a high incidence of abortion and disease in their livestock. Serum samples were obtained from domestic animal populations from areas near Rosso, the best studied focus of human infection, as well as other areas distant from known human disease. Among animals from the area of high incidence of human disease, antibody prevalence was as high as 85\%, with approximately 80\% of the sera positive for both RVFV IgG- and viral-specific IgM antibodies. In contrast, human populations in the same area had lower RVFV antibody prevalences, 40\% or less, with 90\% also being IgM-positive. Sera from livestock in coastal areas 280 km south of the epidemic area were negative for RVFV antibodies. Thus, the detection of RVFV specific IgG and IgM antibodies provided evidence of recent disease activity without the requirement to establish pre-disease antibody levels in populations or individuals and without viral isolation. Subsequently, detection of modest levels of IgG and IgM in the Ferlo region, 130 km south of the Senegal River flood plain, established that RVFV transmission also occurred in another area of the basin. Similar serological testing of domestic ungulates in The Gambia, 340 km south of Rosso, demonstrated antibody prevalence consistent with a lower level of recent transmission of RVFV, i.e., 24\% IgG-positive with 6\% of the positive sera also having RVFV-specific IgM.},

	abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute viral anthropozoonosis causing epizootics/epidemics associated with high toll of morbidity and mortality among human and livestock populations in Africa. In Senegal, RVFV has been repeatedly detected among humans, livestock, and mosquitoes especially in the Northern and the Southern regions. In 2013, multiple RVFV epizootics foci and 5 RVF human confirmed cases were identified countrywide including in the capital city. This paper reports multidisciplinary field investigations and laboratory findings of this outbreak. Human suspected cases and their contacts, ruminants and arthropods in contact with confirmed and/or suspected cases were sampled in affected areas including Linguere (Northern), Mbour (Central) and Kedougou (SouthEastern) regions. Human and animal sera were tested by ELISA (IgM, IgG) and RT-PCR for RVFV. Mosquitoes were sorted in monospecific pools and tested for RVFV RT-PCR detection and isolation. During the human investigation, 535 patients were sampled from which 2.05\% (11/535) were tested positive for RVFV (10 IgM, 1 RT-PCR) including 8 in Mbour, 2 in Kedougou and 1 in Linguere and 4.48\%(24/535) had evidence of RVFV past infection (IgG). In term of clinic signs, it was the first time that RVF severe case with encephalitis and retinitis notified in Senegal. Fifty two animals (12.06\%) were tested positive by RT-PCR for RVFV only in Northern regions. Although no animal's evidence of RVFV recent infection was found in Central and SouthEastern regions, IgG antibodies were significantly higher in Mbour (75\%) than in Kedougou (25.8\%)(p{\textless}0.0001). Concerning entomologic investigation, 645 arthropods were collected and RVF was detected in one pool of mosquitoes in Linguere. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the strains from human and mosquito clustered together. In conclueion, it was the largest spreading of RVFV touching urbanized areas including the capital city. Regarding the potential risk of reemergence through familial breeding, RVF surveillance should be implemented in order to provide promptly suitable and effective preventing and control measures.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the interaction between the various variables associated with Rift Valley fever (RVF) such as the mosquito vector, available hosts and rainfall distribution. To that end, the varying zones potentially occupied by mosquitoes (ZPOM), rainfall events and pond dynamics, and the associated exposure of hosts to the RVF virus by Aedes vexans, were analyzed in the Barkedji area of the Ferlo, Senegal, during the 2003 rainy season. Ponds were identified by remote sensing using a high-resolution SPOT-5 satellite image. Additional data on ponds and rainfall events from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission were combined with in-situ entomological and limnimetric measurements, and the localization of vulnerable ruminant hosts (data derived from QuickBird satellite). Since "Ae. vexans productive events" are dependent on the timing of rainfall for their embryogenesis (six days without rain are necessary to trigger hatching), the dynamic spatio-temporal distribution of Ae. vexans density was based on the total rainfall amount and pond dynamics. Detailed ZPOM mapping was obtained on a daily basis and combined with aggressiveness temporal profiles. Risks zones, i.e. zones where hazards and vulnerability are combined, are expressed by the percentages of parks where animals are potentially exposed to mosquito bites. This new approach, simply relying upon rainfall distribution evaluated from space, is meant to contribute to the implementation of a new, operational early warning system for RVF based on environmental risks linked to climatic and environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic in northern Senegal, a Sahelian area characterized by a temporary pond network that drive both RVF mosquito population dynamics and nomadic herd movements. To investigate the mechanisms that explain RVF recurrent circulation, we modelled a realistic epidemiological system at the pond level integrating vector population dynamics, resident and nomadic ruminant herd population dynamics, and nomadic herd movements recorded in Younoufere area. To calibrate the model, serological surveys were performed in 2015-2016 on both resident and nomadic domestic herds in the same area. Mosquito population dynamics were obtained from a published model trained in the same region. Model comparison techniques were used to compare five different scenarios of virus introduction by nomadic herds associated or not with vertical transmission in Aedes vexans. Our serological results confirmed a long lasting RVF endemicity in resident herds (IgG seroprevalence rate of 15.3\%, n = 222), and provided the first estimation of RVF IgG seroprevalence in nomadic herds in West Africa (12.4\%, n = 660). Multivariate analysis of serological data suggested an amplification of the transmission cycle during the rainy season with a peak of circulation at the end of that season. The best scenario of virus introduction combined yearly introductions of RVFV from 2008 to 2015 (the study period) by nomadic herds, with a proportion of viraemic individuals predicted to be larger in animals arriving during the 2nd half of the rainy season (3.4\%). This result is coherent with the IgM prevalence rate (4\%) found in nomadic herds sampled during the 2nd half of the rainy season. Although the existence of a vertical transmission mechanism in Aedes cannot be ruled out, our model demonstrates that nomadic movements are sufficient to account for this endemic circulation in northern Senegal.},

	abstract = {To investigate past infection in and transmission of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus to humans within an endemic focus, we undertook a retrospective cohort study of the seminomadic Peul people living in sub-Saharan northcentral Senegal. Residents of the rural settlement of Yonofere five years of age or older were studied during February-May 1989. Anti-RVF virus IgG was found in blood samples of 22.3\% of 273 persons who responded to a standard questionnaire; none had IgM antibodies. Seropositivity was similar for males (25.4\%) and females (21.1\%), increased markedly with age for both sexes, and varied considerably among compounds (groups of huts) (0-37.5\%). Risk factors for past RVF virus infection were nursing sick people, assisting animals during abortions/births, and treating sick animals. In all age groups, odds ratios (ORs) for RVF viral antibody among females who reported treating sick animals were three to six times greater than for those who did not. The ORs for males who reported assisting with animal births/abortions and nursing sick people were approximately five times those for males who did not. Serologic prevalence of RVF viral antibody among sheep averaged 30.1\% overall (0.8\% IgM), but varied among compounds (0-66.7\%) in a manner different from that of humans. The seasonal abundance and relative density of potential mosquito vectors were estimated by monthly samples captured in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-type traps. Mosquito abundance varied seasonally with rainfall ({\textgreater} 90\% captures during four months). Species diversity was large (28 spp.), dominated by Aedes and Culex. Rift Valley fever virus was not isolated from 142 pools of 2,956 unengorged mosquitoes tested, although three other arboviruses were found. Results indicate that RVF is endemic in this region, people are at considerable risk of infection, and that a heretofore unrecognized mode of human infection under nonepizootic conditions may be transmission via contact with infected animals or humans.},

	abstract = {Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus that causes Rift Valley fever (RVF), a zoonotic disease that mainly affects domestic and wildlife ruminants and humans. The first epidemic in North-Western and West Africa occurred in Senegal and Mauritania in 1987, two countries where RVF is now endemic. Slaughterhouse workers, farmers, herders and veterinarians are at high risk of exposure to RVF. Beyond the health threat, RVF is considered to cause major socio-economic problems, specifically in developing countries where livestock farming and trade are important economic activities. Indeed, the mortality rate linked to RVF infection can reach 95-100\% in newborns and young animals. In West Africa, livestock production is a key factor for food production and for national economics. Epizootics caused by RVF can therefore have serious socio-economic consequences by impacting multisectoral economics, the psycho-social health of pastoral communities, and food security. Improving prevention strategies against RVF, including vaccination, enhancing knowledge of RVF and correcting any inappropriate behaviors by populations of endemics areas, as well as better monitoring of RVF ecological factors are effective ways to better foresee and control outbreaks of RVF and its socio-economical side-effects in countries at high risk of occurrence of the disease.},

Serum samples were obtained from 1336 persons and from sheer and goats in selected areas, and these were tested for IgG/IgM RVF antibodies by ELISA. After a period of regular decrease in RVF prevalence in domestic animals until 1993, an epizootic was observed in all herds in 1994-95 with increases in IgM levels and abortions. During the same period, no human cases or RVF IgM were detected. The RVF Ige prevalence significantly correlated with dare of birth: children born after 1987 have a low prevalence (5\%) in clear contrast to the older population (25.3\%) in Podor district. A retrospective analysis of rainfall and RVF prevalence in small domestic animals over the last 10 years showed that the re-emergence correlated with heavy rainfall. A general analysis of the risk of re-emergence and the efficiency of this RVF surveillance system are presented.},

	abstract = {Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis caused by a phlebovirus and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Humans can also be infected through direct contact with blood (aerosols) or tissues (placenta, stillborn) of infected animals. Although severe clinical cases can be observed, infection with RVF virus (RVFV) in humans is, in most cases, asymptomatic or causes a febrile illness without serious symptoms. In small ruminants RVFV mainly causes abortion and neonatal death. The distribution of RVFV has been well documented in many African countries, particularly in the north (Egypt, Sudan), east (Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia), west (Senegal, Mauritania) and south (South Africa), but also in the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mayotte) and the Arabian Peninsula. In contrast, the prevalence of RVFV has rarely been investigated in central African countries. Methodology/Principal Findings: We therefore conducted a large serological survey of rural populations in Gabon, involving 4,323 individuals from 212 randomly selected villages (10.3\% of all Gabonese villages). RVFV-specific IgG was found in a total of 145 individuals (3.3\%) suggesting the wide circulation of Rift Valley fever virus in Gabon. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in the lakes region than in forest and savannas zones, with respective rates of 8.3\%, 2.9\% and 2.2\%. In the lakes region, RVFV-specific IgG was significantly more prevalent in males than in females (respectively 12.8\% and 3.8\%) and the seroprevalence increased gradually with age in males but not in females. Conclusions/Significance: Although RVFV was suggested to circulate at a relatively high level in Gabon, no outbreaks or even isolated cases have been documented in the country. The higher prevalence in the lakes region is likely to be driven by specific ecologic conditions favorable to certain mosquito vector species. Males may be more at risk of infection than females because they spend more time farming and hunting outside the villages, where they may be more exposed to mosquito bites and infected animals. Further investigations are needed to determine the putative sylvan cycle of RVFV, including the mosquito species and the reservoir role of wild animals in the viral maintenance cycle.},

Seropositivity rates were similar between sexes and increased significantly with age among nomadic persons. Behavior patterns providing exposure to multifactorial risk factors were gender-based. Male risk factors, primarily associated with herding activities, included sleeping outside during seasonal migrations (also a risk factor for nomadic women), bite by a tick (adult male Hyalomma truncatum), tick bite during the cool dry season, and contact with sick animals. Human infection of CCHF occurred more frequently or with less mortality in the region studied than has been found elsewhere in Africa; however, the rate of seroconversion-associated illness is undetermined.

	abstract = {Background: Lassa fever is caused by a viral haemorrhagic arenavirus that affects two to three million people in West Africa, causing a mortality of between 5,000 and 10,000 each year. The natural reservoir of Lassa virus is the multi-mammate rat Mastomys natalensis, which lives in houses and surrounding fields. With the aim of gaining more information to control this disease, we here carry out a spatial analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and infected rodent hosts covering the period 1965-2007. Information on contemporary environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall, vegetation) was derived from NASA Terra MODIS satellite sensor data and other sources and for elevation from the GTOPO30 surface for the region from Senegal to the Congo. All multi-temporal data were analysed using temporal Fourier techniques to generate images of means, amplitudes and phases which were used as the predictor variables in the models. In addition, meteorological rainfall data collected between 1951 and 1989 were used to generate a synoptic rainfall surface for the same region. Methodology/Principal Findings: Three different analyses (models) are presented, one superimposing Lassa fever outbreaks on the mean rainfall surface (Model 1) and the other two using non-linear discriminant analytical techniques. Model 2 selected variables in a step-wise inclusive fashion, and Model 3 used an information-theoretic approach in which many different random combinations of 10 variables were fitted to the Lassa fever data. Three combinations of absence: presence clusters were used in each of Models 2 and 3, the 2 absence: 1 presence cluster combination giving what appeared to be the best result. Model 1 showed that the recorded outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations occurred in zones receiving between 1,500 and 3,000 mm rainfall annually. Rainfall, and to a much lesser extent temperature variables, were most strongly selected in both Models 2 and 3, and neither vegetation nor altitude seemed particularly important. Both Models 2 and 3 produced mean kappa values in excess of 0.91 (Model 2) or 0.86 (Model 3), making them 'Excellent'. Conclusion/Significance: The Lassa fever areas predicted by the models cover approximately 80\% of each of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 50\% of Guinea, 40\% of Nigeria, 30\% of each of Cote d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin, and 10\% of Ghana.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, working equines have a continued and growing socioeconomic role in supporting the livelihoods of between 300-600 million people in low income countries which is rarely recognised at a national or international level. Infectious diseases have significant impact on welfare and productivity in this population and equine trypanosomiasis is a priority disease due to its severity and prevalence. Strategies are required to improve the prevention, diagnosis, management and treatment of trypanosomiasis in equines and more data are required on the efficacy and safety of current trypanocidal drugs., METHODS: A prospective randomised, open-label non-inferiority trial was performed in The Gambia on horses and donkeys that fulfilled 2/5 clinical inclusion criteria (anaemia, poor body condition, pyrexia, history of abortion, oedema). Following randomised trypanocidal treatment (diminazene diaceturate, melarsomine dihydrochloride or isometamidium chloride), animals were observed for immediate adverse drug reactions and follow-up assessment was performed at 1 and 2 weeks. Blood samples underwent PCR analysis with specific Trypanosoma sp. primers. Treatment efficacy was assessed by measuring changes in clinical parameters, clinicopathological results and PCR-status post-treatment after evaluating for bias. Using PCR status as the outcome variable, non-inferiority of isometamidium treatment was determined if the upper bound limit of a 2-sided 95\% CI was less than 10\%., RESULTS: There was a significant beneficial effect upon the Trypanosoma sp. PCR positive population following trypanocidal treatment for all groups. The findings of clinical evaluation and PCR status supported a superior treatment effect for isometamidium. Melarsomine dihydrochloride efficacy was inferior to isometamidium. There were immediate, self-limiting side effects to isometamidium in donkeys (26\%). Diminazene had the longest duration of action as judged by PCR status., CONCLUSIONS: The data support the continued use of isometamidium following careful dose titration in donkeys and diminazene for trypanosomiasis in equines using the doses and routes of administration reported.},

	abstract = {The Ferlo area (north-central Senegal) is characterized by a system of temporary ponds favorable to arboviruses among which West Nile fever (WNF) was already identified. During the rainy season in 2003, a serological study was undertaken on horses to assess the activity of the WNF virus (WNFV) in Barkedji (Ferlo). The observed serological prevalence rate was 78.3\% for neutralizing antibodies, with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) of [64.0, 92.7]. This prevalence rate significantly increased with age (P = 10(-5)). This study confirmed that WNF was endemic in the Ferlo. The transmission risks depended on the introduction of the WNFV in the ecosystem--probably with migrating birds, on its amplification in hosts and on the vector-population dynamic. Further studies are needed to investigate how the cycle is initiated in Barkedji at the beginning of the rainy season and the impact of climatic variations on the risk of transmission of WNF. A surveillance system should be implemented: (a) to assess the clinical impact of the WNF on human and equine populations, (b) to provide an early detection of virulent strains, and (c) to assess the risk of WNF transmission to disease-free ecosystems via migrating birds.},

	abstract = {TOPIC: Procedures TYPE: Global Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) plays an important role in the management of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and other endemic respiratory diseases. Despite its importance, FB availability is limited to a few institutions in sub-Saharan Africa, primarily due lack of trained physicians, initial cost of procuring equipment, and other constraints related to processing, storage and maintenance.Recently, single use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFB) have been used in high income countries (HIC) with the advantage being that these devices circumvent some of the cost limitations of reusable flexible bronchoscopes (RFBs); and are therefore are an attractive option for many health systems. To date however, there are no publications on the use of SUFBs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We present our experience with the Ambu aScopeTM 3 SUFB at a government hospital in The Gambia, West Africa. CASE PRESENTATION: We evaluated 7 patients referred for bronchoscopy evaluation at the Kanifing General Hospital- a 150-bed hospital. 6 patients were AFB sputum negative, while one could not produce a sputum sample. FB was performed in the operating room with continuous hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring. Procedural sedation was achieved with Ketamine administered by certified nurse anesthetists. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Patients were all male, median age 40 years (IQR 20 - 43) median ESR 95mm/Hr (IQR 17 - 130), HIV + 1/7 (14\%), median WBC 5.22 x 10*9 (IQR- 3.48-7.17).Bronchoscopy was successful in all cases without any complications. We were able to perform an airway examination down to the third order bronchi with targeted bronchial washings that were sent for culture and GeneXpert MTB/RIF. One patient tested positive for TB, while the rest were negative. DISCUSSION: The Ambu aScopeTM 3 SUFB was easy to set up and use. Images obtained were acceptable and allowed for systematic evaluation of the tracheobronchial trees in all cases. A diagnosis of pulmonary TB was established in one patient, who had a negative AFB smear initially, while the rest were diagnosed with sputum negative TB based on clinical criteria. Surveys in The Gambia have reported a high frequency of sputum negative PTB which is consistent with our findings.The total cost for the Ambu aViewTM reusable monitor was US\$6000 while the Ambu aScopeTM 3 SUFB was US \$178 per unit. In comparison, the estimated cost for an RFB setup from a regional vendor was US\$51925 (excluding maintenance and repair). CONCLUSION(S): SUFB can be used in resource constrained settings in SSA with good performance characteristics, making it a viable option for health systems in the region.

Hemoptysis had been the revealing elements of the illness in 80\% of cases. Treatment was by resection in all the cases: 13 pneumonectomy (54\%) and 11 partial resections (46\%). The procedures were usually difficult and hemorrhagic. The global mortality was 20\%, can be explained by the high number of major resections and the unfavourable general state of health of our patients. Post operative complications are mainly due to secondary empyemas encountered in 15\% of the surviving ones. The surgical resection of pulmonary aspergilloma is still difficult and risky for extended underlying parenchymal disease. Minima procedures such as speleotomy and intra cavitary aspiration technique must be indicated in patients with very poor general condition.},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: In West Africa, populations are used to taking traditional medicine as a first aid against common health problems. In this aspect, many plants are claimed to be effective in the treatment of Tuberculosis (TB), which according to the World Health Organization (WHO) remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases. Aim of the study: The main aim of this study was to identify plants used to treat TB-symptoms by the population of Senegal and to evaluate their possible concomitant use with clinically approved TB-drugs. This approach allowed the selection of plants effectively used in traditional medicine. In order to verify if the usage of some of these plants can be rationalized, the activity of their traditional preparations was assessed with both an intracellular and extracellular antimycobacterial host-pathogen assays. Material(s) and Method(s): An ethnopharmacological survey conducted on 117 TB-patients and 30 healers in Senegal from March to May 2014. The questionnaires were focused on the use of medicinal plants to treat common TB -symptoms (cough longer than 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, weight loss and bloody sputum). Local plant names, utilized organs (herbal drugs) and traditional formulations of the plants were recorded. Extracts were prepared by mimicking the traditional decoction in boiling water and screened for their antimycobacterial activity using Mycobacterium marinum, as a validated TB surrogate, and an Acanthamoeba castellanii - M. marinum whole-cell based host-pathogen assay, to detect anti-infective activities. Result(s): By the end of the survey, nearly 30 plants were cited and the 12 most cited herbal drugs were collected and their usage documented by extensive literature search. Extracts of the chosen herbs were screened with the described assays; with a main focus on traditional formulas (mainly herbal decoctions). Two of the water extracts from Combretum aculeatum and Guiera senegalensis showed significant antimycobacterial activities when compared to the positive control drug (rifampin). These extracts showed no observable toxicity against amoeba host cells (Acanthamoeba castellanii). Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that most of the patients do not concomitantly use plants and TB drugs ({\textasciitilde}90\% of informants) but, instead, most are treated with medicinal plants before they are admitted to a hospital (41\%). Interestingly, among the aqueous extracts assayed, two extracts (Combretum aculeatum (Combretaceae) and Guiera senegalensis (Combretaceae)) collected within this survey demonstrate antimycobacterial activities on the validated whole-cell based host-pathogen assay. Both extracts showed significant activities against intracellular and extracellular - M. marinum growth presenting IC50 lower than 0.5 mg/ml compared to the reference drug Rifampin (IC50 of 0.4 and 7 microg/ml). No toxicity was observed for amoebae cells at concentration until 0.8 mg/ml.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Like many infectious agents, yellow fever (YF) virus only causes disease in a proportion of individuals it infects and severe illness only represents the tip of the iceberg relative to the total number of infections, the more critical factor for virus transmission. We compiled data on asymptomatic infections, mild disease, severe disease (fever with jaundice or hemorrhagic symptoms) and fatalities from 11 studies in Africa and South America between 1969 and 2011. We used a Bayesian model to estimate the probability of each infection outcome. For YF virus infections, the probability of being asymptomatic was 0.55 (95\% credible interval [CI] 0.37-0.74), mild disease 0.33 (95\% CI 0.13-0.52) and severe disease 0.12 (95\% CI 0.05-0.26). The probability of death for people experiencing severe disease was 0.47 (95\% CI 0.31-0.62). In outbreak situations where only severe cases may initially be detected, we estimated that there may be between one and seventy infections that are either asymptomatic or cause mild disease for every severe case identified. As it is generally only the most severe cases that are recognized and reported, these estimates will help improve the understanding of the burden of disease and the estimation of the potential risk of spread during YF outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Background: Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. WHO estimates that 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths occur each year in tropical areas of Africa and South America .Although there is no specific treatment for YF, outbreak can be avoided by the vaccination strategy integrating routine EPI and preventive mass vaccination campaigns to maintain a high level immunity among population. Although Kedougou (south - eastern) is known as an YF endemic area, no massive outbreak has ever been reported. Since 2007, gold mining has become the main economic activity in Kedougou and has led to increased urbanization, more activity in the forest and massive immigration of non-immune populations. A YF outbreak occurred in Kedougou in 2010 and YF seroprevalence was 58.8\% despite the preventive immunization campaign carried out in 2007. Methods \& Materials: The sampling method was based on a two level cross sectional random cluster sample design adapted from WHO. Kedougou region was divided into 3 districts in which 40 villages were drawn at random, using the cumulative total population. Samples were tested for anti YFV IgG antibodies by ELISA, and neutralizing antibodies against YFV. Result(s): The overall YF immunity seroprevalence in the region was 49.04\% [39.3-59.5]. Salemata district presented the highest prevalence of neutralizing antibodies with 57.3\% [47- 67](p = 0.0048).The [31-45years] were better protected than children with a protective YF antibodies seroprevalence 57\% [46.7- 66.7] (p = 0.0019). Also adults in Khossanto and Fongolimbi rural communities (gold mining sites) were significantly less immunized against YF than those in Kedougou town with respectively OR= 0.31[0.16-0.58] and OR= 0.62 [0.39-0.97]. Conclusion(s): This study showed that the rapid decrease of YF immunity (49\%) below the required threshold (80\%) to prevent outbreaks only four years after the preventive immunization campaign was due mainly to the increase of traditional gold mining which attracts non immune population in the region.},

Among these strains, 3 were isolated from males and this very important phenomenon might explain the virus conservation during the dry season. In 1978, 55 strains were isolated from mosquitoes of the same species, but not from males, and five from monkeys (E. patas and C. aethiops). But no increase of morbidity or mortality was observed in humans. In December 1978, a YF outbreak occurred in Gambia with 271 suspect cases and 63 deaths; 2 strains were isolated from A. aegypti. In 1979, the epidemic seemed to have disappeared. Up to now, one single strain has been isolated from mosquitoes.

	abstract = {An epidemic of yellow fever (YF) occurred in the Gambia between May 1978 and January 1979. Retrospective case-finding methods and active surveillance led to the identification of 271 clinically suspected cases. A confirmatory or presumptive laboratory diagnosis was established in 94 cases. The earliest serologically documented case occurred in June 1978, at the extreme east of the Gambia. Small numbers of cases occurred in August and September. The epidemic peaked in October, and cases continued to occur at a diminishing rate through January, when a mass vaccination campaign was completed. The outbreak was largely confined to the eastern half of the country (MacCarthy Island and Upper River Divisions). In nine survey villages in this area (total population 1,531) the attack rate was 2.6--4.4\%, with a mortality rate of 0.8\%, and a case fatality rate of 19.4\%. If these villages are representative of the total affected region, there may have been as many as 8,400 cases and 1,600 deaths during the outbreak. The disease incidence was highest in the 0- to 9-year age group (6.7\%) and decreased with advancing age to 1.7\% in persons over 40 years. Overall, 32.6\% of survey village inhabitants had YF complement-fixing (CF) antibodies. The prevalence of antibody patterns indicating primary YF infection decreased with age, in concert with disease incidence. The overall inapparent:apparent infection ratio was 12:1. In persons with serological responses indicating flaviviral superinfection, the inapparent:apparent infection ratio was 10 times higher than in persons with primary YF infection. Sylvatic vectors of YF virus, principally Aedes furcifer-taylori and Ae. luteocephalus are believed to have been responsible for transmission, at least at the beginning of the outbreak. Eighty-four percent of wild monkeys shot in January 1979 had YF neutralizing antibodies, and 32\% had CF antibodies. Domestic Aedes aegypti were absent or present at very low indices in many severely affected villages (see companion paper). In January, however, aegypti-borne YF 2.5 months into the dry season was documented by isolation of YF virus from a sick man and from this vector species in the absence of sylvatic vectors. Thus, in villages where the classical urban vector was abundant, interhuman transmission by Ae. aegypti occurred and continued into the dry season. A mass vaccination campaign, begun in December, was completed on 25 January, with over 95\% coverage of the Gambian population. A seroconversion rate of 93\% was determined in a group of vaccinees. This outbreak emphasizes the continuing public health importance of YF in West Africa and points out the need for inclusion of 17D YF vaccination in future programs of multiple immunication.},

In Senegal and particularly in the eastern part of the country, periodic sylvatic circulation has been demonstrated with varying degrees of impact on populations in perpetual renewal. We report an outbreak that occurred from October 2020 to February 2021 in eastern Senegal, notified and managed through the synergistic effort yellow fever national surveillance implemented by the Senegalese Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the countrywide 4S network set up by the Ministry of Health, the Institut Pasteur de Dakar, and the surveillance of arboviruses and hemorrhagic fever viruses in human and vector populations implemented since mid 2020 in eastern Senegal. Virological analyses highlighted the implication of sylvatic mosquito species in virus transmission. Genomic analysis showed a close relationship between the circulating strain in eastern Senegal, 2020, and another one from the West African lineage previously detected and sequenced two years ago from an unvaccinated Dutch traveler who visited the Gambia and Senegal before developing signs after returning to Europe. Moreover, genome analysis identified a 6-nucleotide deletion in the variable domain of the 3'UTR with potential impact on the biology of the viral strain that merits further investigations. Integrated surveillance of yellow fever virus but also of other arboviruses of public health interest is crucial in an ecosystem such as eastern Senegal.},

The immune status against YF virus of a sample population of 449 individuals was determined, and 31 confirmed cases and 69 asymptomatic cases were reported. Distribution of YF cases and incidence rate decreased with age, while the attack rate was stable in all age groups. Larva indices were high and Aedes aegypti was common in all villages, causing man-to-man transmission. The greatest risk of YF disease was lack of immunity, especially in individuals {\textless}20 years of age. The outbreak was rapidly controlled by an emergency immunization campaign. YF epidemics occurred in Senegal over two consecutive years. The last outbreak reached the main road to Dakar and the risk of spread to urban areas has increased.},
